Interested in joining our group? 

 - We welcome all talented students and researchers with common research interests to join our group,  regardless of their genders, nationalities, or seniority. We offer various opportunities including PhD/master programs, postdocs, bachelor thesis training, internships, etc. However, depending on available funding and a number of bureaucratic reasons, the actual situation varies every year. Interested applicants are encouraged to contact [Xunjie Xu](/about/) at least six months (except for undergraduate internships) in advance.

 - Currently all our group members are [coffee medal](/_posts/2021-09-18-coffee.md) awardee. We encourage interested applicants to give it a try---see the coffee medal problems [here](/files/questions-v2.pdf).

 - Home office is in general permitted for postdocs, subjected to a few negotiable conditions. So in principle, it is possible to work in our group as a postdoc without staying in Beijing.
