Interested in joining our group? 

 - We welcome all talent students and researchers with common research interests to join our group, independent of their genders, nationalities, or seniority. 

 - Depending on the funding situation and a number of bureaucratic reasons, we may offer a variety of job opportunities including PhD/master programs, postdocs, bachelor thesis training, internships, etc. Interested applicants are suggested to contact [Xunjie Xu](/about/) at least six months (except for undergraduate internships) in advance.

 - Regarding the coffee medal(), we encourage all interested applicants to give it a try, though this is not required. Currently all our group members are coffee medal awardees. 

 - Home office is in general encouraged for postdocs, subjected to a few conditions that can be negotiated. So in principle, it is possible to work in our group as a postdoc without staying in Beijing.
