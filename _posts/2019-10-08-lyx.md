# What is LyX?
This is the [LyX website](https://www.lyx.org/)

My answer to the question:
it is a very very efficient tool to write latex documents

# Why not write latex code directly?
If you are using vim editing Tex code, then I would simply say "enjoy coding!" and refrain from any comments :-)

If you are using MikTex+WinEdit (many Windows users), or TeXLive+Texmaker (many linux users), I'm sure at some point you would really hate writing latex code.

If you don't know what MikTex/TeXLive is, then this article is not suitable for you.

# How to use LyX efficiently?
## writing latex code instead of moving your mouse to click the buttons.
When writing raw latex code, taking this expression 
![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.download?%24%5Cnu_%5Cmu%20%5Crightarrow%20%5Cnu_%5Ctau%24) for example, you need a lot of keystrokes to input
$\nu_\mu \rightarrow \nu_\tau$

Many beginners probably use LyX in this way:
click "Insert">"Math">"Inline formular", then click the notation of ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.download?%24%5Cnu%24), click the button for subscript,...., which is very very low efficient.

If you are a little more advanced users, you may use a lot of shortcut keys to do that. But you may realise that you fingers jump too much on the keyboard.

The best way I would recommend (you need to configure LyX properly):

1. ctrl+M (equivalent to starting the math enviroment $$ when you write the raw code) 
2. type \nu_\mu
3. press the spacebar twice (you will see how the cursor moves if you only press once)
4. type \ri..., press enter (you don't need to fully type "\rightarrow". Depending on how frequent you type "\ri" is enough for LyX to auto-complete)
5. type \nu_\tau, press spacebar three times to jump out of the math mode

Actually you see step 1 takes same (or less) number of keystrokes as typing $$ (on normal keybaords, you need to press shift to input $), step 2 and 5 cost same, step 4 reduces keystrokes.

Most importantly, you see the expression immediately without runing latex/pdflatex to generate pdf.

If you're really keen into writing the raw code, here is another way
1. ctrl+L,
2. type \nu_\mu \rightarrow \nu_\tau

## Using shortcut keys as much as you can
