## What is it?

Anyone who solves the problems in this [pdf](/files/questions.pdf) will be awarded a cup of coffee (or tea) in/around my office at IHEP, Beijing. 
The Coffee Medal will be printed on the coffee mug used to serve coffee/tea to you. You can keep the mug and show it off in front of, e.g., your boyfriend/girlfriend and your colleagues. It won't be useful on any formal occasions. But if you're a Coffee Medal winner and you're applying for master/PhD/postdoc positions in our group, you will be given the highest priority. 

## How to apply?
Just send your answer sheet to me via email (my contact info can be found on this website). Your answer doesn't have to be correct for you to win the medal. Besides, you don't have to solve all the problems. 


## Not just coffee
Given that the prize is just coffee (+ a mug), you might ask: "why would I bother to do basic physics exercise?" 
Well, it's not just coffee! 
The problems are all at the textbook level (e.g., Peskin&Schroesder, Turner&Kolb). 
They aim to help students learn basic techniques that will be required in their research.
